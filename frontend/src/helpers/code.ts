AI Image Authenticity Detector

This system is designed to identify AI-generated and manipulated images
using a multi-stage analysis pipeline.

Core Techniques Used:
• Frequency-domain analysis (FFT)
• Wavelet-based texture decomposition
• Pixel-level noise and artifact detection

Instead of relying on visual appearance alone, the system analyzes
mathematical and statistical patterns that are difficult for
generative models to replicate.

The extracted features are fused into a machine learning model
that outputs a probabilistic authenticity score.

Goal:
To combat misinformation, prevent misuse of synthetic media,
and help restore trust in digital images.
